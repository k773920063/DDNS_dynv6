# DDNS_dynv6
This Script only for ipv6.  
You can choose 2 ways to realize the function: by bitsadmin or curl(prefer).  
(Prefer curl: I found the task schedule can't run bitsadmin as want).  
You can debug with script.bat, then edit "DDNS_dynv6.bat" and "silent_run_script.vbe" that you can add .vbe to your task schedule.
